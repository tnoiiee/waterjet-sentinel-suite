# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are recorded in this file.

The format follows the spirit of *Keep a Changelog*, adapted for a stage-gated project:
each entry corresponds to an approved Delivery Stage, not to a release of software.
This repository currently contains documentation only.

Versioning while pre-release: `0.<stage>.<checkpoint>`.
The product version `1.0.0` is reserved for the first Owner-accepted deployment release.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet. Work may only begin under a newly approved Stage Gate.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-10-04

**Stage 0.1 — Repository Documentation Foundation** `[APPROVED]`

Documentation-only stage. Established the repository governance model, the product
identity baseline, the queue and control models, and the delivery plan. No application
code, runtime scaffold, database schema, hardware adapter, CI workflow, production
configuration, release package, or archive was created.

### Added

- Repository governance
  - `AGENTS.md` — working contract for automated and human contributors: authority
    order, scope-lock rules, evidence-first rules, version and checkpoint rules,
    public-repository restrictions, device-access prohibition, destructive Git
    prohibition, Owner-only merge rule, Changed/Unchanged/Not Verified reporting,
    no-false-test-claims rule, and required stop conditions.
  - `SECURITY.md` — security policy, secret handling, vulnerability reporting,
    privileged-session expectations, and the public-repository secrecy boundary.
  - `CHANGELOG.md` — this file.
- Core documentation
  - `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` — verified repository state, status legend, and open items.
  - `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` — staged delivery plan, stage gates, and gate evidence rules.
  - `docs/ROADMAP.md` — forward view of planned stages and optional future capabilities.
  - `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` — consolidated requirements with identifiers and status.
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — conceptual architecture and subsystem responsibilities.
  - `docs/DOMAIN_MODEL.md` — entities, terminology, identifiers, and value ranges.
- Control, safety, and queue models
  - `docs/SAFETY_BOUNDARY.md` — hardware safety boundary, target safe states, and the
    bench verification required before any production write control is permitted.
  - `docs/CONTROL_AUTHORITY.md` — control authority matrix for every output.
  - `docs/CLEANING_SEQUENCE.md` — Cleaning Job definition, normal sequence, and
    failure and recovery boundaries.
  - `docs/ALARM_MODEL.md` — condition, acknowledgement, and shelving dimensions,
    severities, and blocking-release rules.
  - `docs/QUEUE_MODEL.md` — TempQueue, TimeQueue, GlobalQueue, deduplication,
    FIFO refill, and operator queue actions.
  - `docs/HISTORIAN_RETENTION.md` — acquisition intervals, storage targets, retention
    proposals, and cleanup rules.
  - `docs/USER_PERMISSION_MODEL.md` — role templates, session rules, audit
    requirements, and the break-glass recovery account.
  - `docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md` — planned verification approach for future stages, and the
    explicit statement that no runtime testing has occurred.
  - `docs/PUBLIC_REPOSITORY_BOUNDARY.md` — what may and may not be published.
- Decision records
  - `docs/decisions/README.md` — ADR index and format.
  - `docs/decisions/ADR-0001-product-identity.md`
  - `docs/decisions/ADR-0002-deployment-architecture.md`
  - `docs/decisions/ADR-0003-queue-arbitration.md`
  - `docs/decisions/ADR-0004-historian-strategy.md`
  - `docs/decisions/ADR-0005-hardware-safety-boundary.md`

### Changed

- `README.md` — replaced the two-line placeholder with the full repository entry point,
  product identity statement, physical baseline summary, and document index.
- `.gitignore` — extended the existing Visual Studio template with repository-specific
  exclusions for local production configuration, secrets, and exported data, so that
  confidential deployment material stays outside the public repository.

### Safety and scope notes for this entry

- No production device access was performed. Production device access remains
  `[NOT AUTHORIZED]`.
- WAGO watchdog fail-safe behaviour remains `[NOT VERIFIED]`.
- Motion limits, pulses per engineering unit, encoder behaviour, and pressure setpoints
  remain `[NOT VERIFIED]`.
- Production register maps and tag lists were not created and must never be committed;
  see `docs/PUBLIC_REPOSITORY_BOUNDARY.md`.
- No runtime, database, or hardware test was executed. Only documentation validation was
  performed. See `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` for the validation record.
